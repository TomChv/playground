## Step 0 - Initialization

All the required information to start this workshop can be found in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

## Story

Last week, your best friend told you about a great technology that allows you to create an API in just a few lines without going through the traditional architecture: GraphQL APIs.<br>
Thanks to this technology, he had fun on the public API of Star Wars to make a small site about the different episodes and actors.<br>
Curious by nature and looking for something new, you decide to set up your little online store project with this new technology.

## Step 1 - Welcome to GraphQl Playground

Your first reflex is to try the Star Wars API to play with Graphql and understand concepts.

  - Go to [Star Wars API](https://hc-starwars.azurewebsites.net/playground/)

Let's do some queries to retrieve data : 
  - Retrieve all characters' name, height and the episodes they appear in.
  - Retrieve the total count of reviews and all reviews' commentary and the stars
  - Retrieve the name and id of the hero of the `JEDI` episode with all his friends' name and id

It's time to discover mutation ! Let's create a new review for your favorite episode.
  - Create a review and retrieve the episode with the review
  - Verify that your review is presented with a simple query that you made previously

Now let's play with funny queries :
  - Retrieve the hero's id, name and height of the `EMPIRE` episode with all his friends' id, name and height. The height must be in `FOOT` unit.
  - Create a query combination that retrieves all characters' id, name and height sort by their height in descending order `AND` also retrieve hero and friends from the `EMPIRE` episode

##### Resources

- [GraphQL syntax](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)
- [Apollo playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/graphql-playground/)

## Step 2 - Hello Apollo

It's time to try graphql, simplest and most popular library is [Apollo server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server).

### Setup backend

Create a folder named `backend` to develop your API.
Download the [source](./sources/backend.zip) and extract it in the `backend` folder.

Your directory should have the following structure :

```shell
.
├── package.json # Package manager
├── prisma
│   └── schema.prisma # Database
├── source-backend.zip # Remove this
├── src
│   ├── context.ts # Integrate database to API Context
│   ├── feeds
│   │   └── feed.ts # Feed database
│   ├── helpers
│   │   └── Errors.ts # Apollo custom errors 
│   ├── resolver # All resolvers (queries and mutations)
│   │   ├── Categories
│   │   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   │   ├── mutations.ts
│   │   │   └── queries.ts
│   │   ├── Hello
│   │   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   │   ├── mutations.ts
│   │   │   └── queries.ts
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   └── Products
│   │       ├── index.ts
│   │       ├── mutations.ts
│   │       └── queries.ts
│   ├── schema
│   │   └── schema.graphql # GraphQL schema
│   ├── schema.ts # Compute schema and resolver
│   └── server.ts # Apollo Server
├── tsconfig.json # Typescript configuration
└── yarn.lock # Dependencies file
```

To start the project, execute the following commands :
```shell
$ yarn # Install dependencies
$ yarn migrate # Init database and prisma client
$ yarn dev # Start server in developer mode
```

Go to http://localhost:5000 to reach the local playground of your API.

### Basics functions

We will start with some basic function to warm up, let's write :
 - a query named `hello` that return the `string` "Hello World"
 - a query named `personalHello` that takes a `string` as parameter and return : "Hello " + the parameter
 - a mutation named `add` that takes two numbers as parameters and return the additive

First, you must modify the schema in `src/schema/schema.graphql` to define your query and mutation.

Then you can define your queries and mutation in `src/resolver/Hello/` folder.

> :bulb: You can auto feed your database through the `yarn feed`.

##### Resources
  - [Apollo schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/schema/)
  - [Apollo queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/resolvers/)
  - [Apollo mutations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/mutation-resolvers/)

## Step 3 - Schema

Warm up is finished. It's time to create schema that define our API.

The database schema is already defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

First, you must modify `src/schema/schema.graphql` to implement two new types :
  - `Category` that has the same fields as model `Category` in `schema.prisma`.
  - `Product` that has the same fields as model `Product` in `schema.prisma`.

Then, create resolvers that can read of `Category` and `Product` :
 - a query `categories` that return all categories 
 - a query `category` takes an `id` as parameter and return the category.
 - a query `products` that return all products
 - a query `product` takes an `id` as parameter and return the product.

> :bulb: You can add comments that will be displayed in the playground with `"`.

You can now write `resolvers` in `src/resolver/Categories` and `src/resolver/Products`.

##### Resources
  - [Apollo schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/schema/)
  - [Apollo queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/resolvers/)
  - [Apollo mutations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/mutation-resolvers/)
  - [Prisma CRUD operation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud#create)

## Step 4 - CRUD

Now that you have queries to read data, it's time to modify our products and categories.

In `src/schema/schema.graphql`:

Create two `input` that defines arguments for mutation :
 - `CategoryInput`: input fields for a new category
 - `ProductInput`: input fields for a new product

:bulb: Don't forget to add fields from relation to allow connection between entities.

Add the following `Mutation` in `src/schema/schema.graphql`:
 - `createProduct` that takes an `input` of type `ProductInput` as parameter and return the product created in the database.
 - `updateProduct` that takes an `input` of type `ProductInput` as parameter and return the product updated in the database.
 - `deleteProduct` that takes an `id`  as parameter and return the product deleted from the database.
 - `createCategory` that takes an `input` of type `CategoryInput` as parameter and return the category created in the database.
 - `updateCategory` that takes an `input` of type `CategoryInput` as parameter and return the category updated in the database.
 - `deleteCategory` that takes an `id`  as parameter and return the category deleted from the database.

> :bulb: Don't forget to write documentation for your mutation and queries with commentaries

Your schema is defined, you can now write `resolvers` in `src/resolver/Categories` and `src/resolver/Products`.

In case of errors (e.g: a negative product price): you should use custom Apollo errors defined in `src/helpers/Errors.ts`.

- [Prisma CRUD operation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud#create)


## Step 5 - Integration with Apollo Client

Now that you have finished your API, it's time to develop your web application.

Go back to the root of the workshop's folder and create a new folder `fronted`.
Download the [source](./sources/frontend.zip) and extract it in the `frontend` folder.

Your directory should have the following structure :

```shell
├── package.json # Package manager
├── public # Public directory with not important stuff
├── source-front.zip
├── src 
│   ├── Api # API connection and types definition
│   │   ├── client.ts
│   │   └── Entities.ts
│   ├── AppBar # Top bar
│   │   └── AppBar.tsx
│   ├── App.css 
│   ├── App.test.tsx
│   ├── App.tsx # App root
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.tsx # Index
│   ├── react-app-env.d.ts
│   ├── reportWebVitals.ts
│   └── setupTests.ts
├── tsconfig.json # Typescript config
└── yarn.lock # Dependencies lock
```

To start the project, execute the following commands :
```shell
$ yarn # Install dependencies
$ yarn start # Start server in developer mode
```

The objective is to have a simple front with a menu that shows the list of all products.
Here is an example made with the [material UI library](https://material-ui.com/) :

![Menu maquette](./.github/assets/graphql-product-workshop.png)

Create a new component `ProductsList` that lists all products existing in the database.
To do it, you must use [useQuery Apollo hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#executing-a-query) and React.

If you are not familiar to react, take a loot at this [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

 - [React with Typescript](https://blog.bitsrc.io/5-strong-reasons-to-use-typescript-with-react-bc987da5d907)

## Bonus

You know how to create a GraphQL and interact with it from frontend through the `apolloClient`.

You should now implement more functionalities like :
  - User management's
  - Button and forms to add products
  - Page Routing
  - A button to delete and update products
  - A button to sell products
